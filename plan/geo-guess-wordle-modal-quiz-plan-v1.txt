Geo-Guess Wordle — Modal Quiz Plan (v1)
	1.	Modal + backdrop (focus trap)

	•	Show when user clicks Start.
	•	Background is dimmed and not interactive (use inert on the main app + aria-hidden fallback).
	•	Modal has role="dialog", aria-modal="true", and focus moves into it on open.

	2.	Quiz content

	•	Fetch a flag image for a country (e.g., Rest Countries API).
	•	Show 3 options (one correct).
	•	Keyboard support: arrow keys / tab to move; Enter/Space to choose.

	3.	Answer handling + map coloring

	•	On answer: record correct/incorrect, color the country on the map (visible even through the translucent overlay).
	•	Overlay stays up, but map updates can be seen beneath it.

	4.	“Continue” button (pause/return)

	•	User can close the modal any time to return to the map view (game state persists).
	•	Focus returns to the Start/Continue control (or the last meaningful control).

	5.	End of game

	•	When all ~200 countries are colored, show a congratulatory modal with stats and a “Play again” option.

	6.	Reload behavior

	•	The Reload button is disabled while the modal is open, enabled when it’s closed (or always visible but disabled via .disabled class).

	7.	Focus trap rules

	•	Trap Tab/Shift+Tab within the modal.
	•	First interactive element gains focus on open; close returns focus to the opener.
	•	Escape to close is optional (nice-to-have).

	8.	State management

	•	Basic states: IDLE → ROUND_ACTIVE (modal) ↔ MAP_VIEW → FINISHED.
	•	Keep sets: answered, correct, incorrect.
	•	Persist progress in sessionStorage (later: opt-in localStorage).

	9.	Accessibility & performance

	•	aria-live="polite" for feedback text.
	•	Keep overlay semi-transparent, block pointer events to the background.
	•	Debounce any window resize work; no heavy work inside mousemove.

	10.	Error & offline handling

	•	Graceful fallback if the flag API fails (retry or show a placeholder flag + country name).

Study & Learn mode — what you do next

Your task 1 (small, focused):
Build just the modal shell + focus trap (no API yet).
	•	HTML: a .modal (hidden by default) with: heading, image placeholder, three buttons for options, a “Continue” button, and a visually-hidden feedback region.
	•	CSS: backdrop that dims the page.
	•	JS: openModal() → sets inert on main, adds aria-hidden="true" to main as fallback, shows modal, moves focus to first button.
closeModal() → reverses that and returns focus to the opener.
Implement a simple focus trap: collect focusables inside modal and loop on Tab/Shift+Tab.
