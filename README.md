# Geo Guess Country

This is my **first frontend portfolio project**, created after completing the **Frontend Masters Path: Beginner** track.  
The main purpose is to demonstrate the skills I acquired during the course by building an interactive geography quiz game on top of an SVG world map.  

The development and debugging process was supported by **ChatGPT**, which helped me resolve issues and generate parts of the code. In particular, the **map zoom animation** was fully generated with ChatGPT’s assistance.

## Skills Demonstrated  

- **HTML5**: semantic structure and accessibility basics  
- **CSS3**: responsive layouts, custom buttons, modals, and dropdown menus  
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**:  
  - DOM manipulation and event handling  
  - Game logic implementation  
  - Asynchronous programming with `async/await` and `fetch`  
  - State management for quiz progress, scores, and UI  
  - Working with **objects** and **arrays**  
  - Using **map**, **filter**, **spread**, and **destructuring**  
- **SVG integration**: interactive continents and countries  
- **Animations**: CSS transitions + programmatic **SVG zoom** animation  
- **Debugging & iteration**: development process supported by ChatGPT

# Flag & Map Quiz

A lightweight, client-side geography quiz. Guess the country from a flag, answer inside a modal, and watch the world map color as you progress.

> **Stack:** HTML + CSS + vanilla JS (ES modules). No build step. Works on GitHub Pages.

---

## Features

- Modal quiz with keyboard navigation and focus management
- World map coloring + zoom; continent/country tooltips
- Dropdown navigation with optional country search
- Robust flag loading (validation + safe Blob cleanup) to avoid broken images and memory leaks
- Uniform scroll-lock via `html.no-scroll`
- Race-safe rounds via `runId`
- Unbiased Fisher–Yates shuffle for options

---

## Quick start

### Local (static server recommended)
Because the app fetches SVG/JSON, serve it locally for reliability:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

### Deploy on GitHub Pages
1. Push this repo.
2. Settings → Pages → Branch: `main`, folder: `/ (root)`.
3. Site: `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`

Tip: Keep relative paths (`./svg/...`, `./js/...`) so the app works under the repo subpath.

---

## How to play

1. Click Start to open the modal.
2. Look at the flag and pick the correct country.
3. Counters update; the country is colored on the map.
4. Click Next to continue; Reload restarts the game.
5. When all countries are colored, you’ll see a confetti celebration and a winner picture.

Keyboard: Arrow keys navigate options; Enter confirms; focus is trapped inside the modal.

---

## Configuration

- Flag template URL: `quiz.flagTemplateURL` (expects `#` for ISO-2), e.g. `https://flagcdn.com/w320/#.png`
- Data: `./js/continents-countries.json` (modernized names/continents)
- Scroll lock: toggles `html.no-scroll`
- Key classes: `.is-open`, `.is-correct`, `.is-wrong`, `.marked`, etc.

## Key decisions

- ES modules for top-level await and module scoping.
- Scroll lock on `<html>` for consistent behavior across modal/dropdown.
- Flag loading: validate first; if using Blob URLs, always revoke previous and current (on load/error).
- Fisher–Yates for unbiased randomization.
- Tooltip hides on mouseleave to avoid “stuck” tooltips.

---

## Accessibility

- Inert background + focus management while the modal is open.
- `aria-expanded` on dropdown toggles; clear focus outlines.
- Consider `role="dialog"` and `aria-labelledby` on the modal root.

---

## Assets

Location: ./img/

- ocean.png — decorative ocean under-layer for the world map
- image-1.png... — images for the congratulations modal

## Prize images (winner modal)

Folder: ./img/
Naming convention: image-<n>.png  (sequential, 1-based)

- Purpose: used in the winner/congratulations modal. The app selects the image
  by prize place (1 → `image-1.png`, 2 → `image-2.png`, etc.).
- Current range: 1..6
- Requirements:
  - Filenames must stay sequential and lowercase: image-1.png … image-6.png
  - PNG format (you may add WebP variants later)
  - Do not rename or skip numbers (e.g., no image-3.png missing)
- Sizing: handled by CSS. For layout stability, prefer setting either
  `width`/`height` attributes in HTML or a fixed `aspect-ratio` in CSS.

Example getter:
`getPrizeImageSrc(n) => ./img/image-${n}.png` (clamped to the current range)

## Pre-deploy checklist

- [ ] Modal blocks page scroll (desktop + iOS/Android).
- [ ] Tooltip hides when pointer leaves SVG.
- [ ] Blob URLs are revoked (no memory growth).
- [ ] No broken flags (bad IDs are skipped gracefully).
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works and focus restores on close.
- [ ] Relative imports (no absolute `/`) for GitHub Pages.
